Changelog for Kaiki v1.2:
----------------------------------------
  File: features/step_definitions/form_steps.rb
    Step Definition: "When I (set|set the) _____ to something like _____"
      Changed to: "When I (set|set the) _____ text area to _____".
      Reason: To better reflect what this form step does. This step is only used
              for filling in the contents of a "text area" control.

    Step Definition: "When I (set the|set) _____ to _____"
      Change: Modified the Approximation Factory xpaths to use match by "."
              instead of "text()", allowing us to eliminate factory8 and make
              the run of these slightly faster. 
      Reason: We discovered that <div> tags will not necessarily be found with
              "text()", but will always be found using ".".

    Step Definition: (New) "When I (set|set the) _____ to something like _____"
      Purpose: To allow setting a drop down box using a fuzzy match. Using
               "When I (set|set the) _____ to _____" on a drop down box
               requires an exact match.

    Step Definition: "When I set _____ for _____ as _____"
      Changed to: "When I set _____ (under|for) _____ as _____"
      Reason: Allow for English variation of feature file creation.
      Change: Modified from using a single special case xpath to using an array
              of special cases.
      Reason: This method is for special cases that will cause conflicts when
              using "When I (set|set the) _____ to _____".

    Step Definition: (New) When "I click the _____ radio button"
      Purpose: Due to how radio buttons operate, radio options conflict with
               other type of buttons and cannot be simply "clicked" like other
               buttons.


  File: features/step_definitions/navigation_steps.rb
    Step Definition: "When I am on the _____ document tab"
      Change: Modified to ignore a fail on switching to the "iframeportlet"
              frame.
      Reason: Some pages do not use the "iframeportlet" frame. 

    Step Definition: "When I (click|click the) _____ (button|(on|to) _____) _____"
      Change: Modified to ignore a fail on switching to the "iframeportlet"
              frame.
      Reason: Some pages do not use the "iframeportlet" frame. 
      Change: Implemented the "edit" and "open proposal" special case buttons.

    Step Definition: (New) "Then a new browser window appears"
      Purpose: Change the focus to the new browser popup window.
  
    Step Definition: (New) "When I click the _____ search link"
      Purpose: To prevent conflicts between links on the Central Admin page
               and portal links.
  
    Step Definition: (New) "When I click Award ID"
      Purpose: This sorts the list of Awards by the Award ID, placing the newest
               one on top.
      Reason: This is to prevent conflicts with malformed Award documents from
              prior failed test runs.
  

  File: features/step_definitions/verification_steps.rb
    Method: (New) verify_text(label, text, mode)
      Purpose: This method will recieve the label and text parameters, along
               with an optional mode parameter and determine if the label and
               the text match based on the mode. The default mode is to use an
               exact match.
      
    Step Definition: "Then I should (see|see the message) _____(_____| (as|(set|next) to) _____ _____)"
      Change: Modified to ignore a fail on switching to the "iframeportlet"
              frame.
      Reason: Some pages do not use the "iframeportlet" frame. 
      Change: Moved most of the code into the verify_text method.
      Reason: The verify_text method now allows for a fuzzy match option when 
              comparing text.
  
    Step Definition: (New) "Then I should see _____ set to something like _____ _____"
      Purpose: This step definition is for invoking verify_text using the fuzzy
               match option.

    Step Definition: "Then I should see one or more items retrieved"
      Change: Changed the text searched for on the screen to "retrieved"
      Reason: Some record lookups do not have the "return value" option 


  File: features/support/env.rb
    Block: SHARED_PASSWORDS_FILE
      Change: Code moved to capybara_base_driver.rb
      Reason: Moved by Josh.

    Method: Before
      Change: Reinstated code to start video capture if running headless.

    Method: After
      Change: Reinstated code to stop video capture if running headless.


  File: lib/kaiki/capybara_driver_base.rb
    Method: (New) last_window_focus
      Purpose: Switches the focus to the most recently created window.
