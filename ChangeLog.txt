Changelog for Kaiki (Oct. 24th - Nov. 25th)
------------------------

> Added location awareness to the xpaths that are used in each bit of code.
  This is to keep the scope of work within specific tabs, sections or
  subsections of the page when necessary.

> Added xpaths and approximate xpath factories, where necessary, to run the new
  tests for the Kuali Financial system, as deployed by the University of
  Arizona.
  Features 1 - 14 for the Kuali Coeus system and feature PA004, specifically
  scenarios 1 - 5 for the Kuali Financial system can be run currently.

> Included comments to each approximate xpath factory, so that it can be seen
  which web pages and tests the particular factories apply to. This is for the
  future move to using page objects, so a more OOP approach can be taken,
  hopefully decreasing test times and maintenance hassle.

> Included a new gem called 'net-ssh', which is required for the ssh commands
  we run for processing batch.

> Commented out the headless.rb file located in features/support/ because
  it is currently unecessary.

> Added in retry functionality to logging in via webauth because sometimes the
  site doesn't always load propoerly the first time.

> Added 8 new methods to capybara_drive_base.rb, the functionality of these
  methods includes:
  * Switching focus to new windows and closing extra windows
  * Opening a calendar element and selecting a date from it
  * Executing javascript that may be needed
  * Retrieving the system date for use in tests
  * Method get_ready combines the three things (kaiki.pause,
    kaiki.switch_default_content, kaiki.select_frame) nearly all step
    definitions use into one easily accessible function.
